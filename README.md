<i>One can Login or Register and create profile with Experience, Education, job detail,etc...The listing of user is done and one can see others profile
and also a user can post status and like or dislike and comment in post whether it's own or others post.</i>


#To use this we can simply
1. git clone "URl of  repository"
2. npm install in root directory
3. cd client and npm install
4. make a default.json folder and add mongoDB credential to connect app to the database.
5. Also add JWTSecret in default.json folder
6. In root directly run "npm run dev" it starts both server at port 5000 and frontend at port 3000.

After this it would be good to go....
